==========  Super-duper NES project!  ==========

This is a project that extends NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) with FPGA (DE0-CV board). Remember Nintendo Disk System? This Super-duper NES is similar to that legendary system. We impliment original ROM on the FPGA and add new feature to NES. With this FPGA, NES will bocome the one that never existed before. You can add your own feature with FPGA.
